# Babelaas Contact Application
Babelaas is a contact application with the design of helping users remember additonal information about stored phone contacts. 
The name comes from the South African slang for hangover, which ties into the problem of not being able to remember older stored contacts.
The application uses account creation and login functionality, so users can download and transfer contacts from different phones. 

When a new contact is created while using Babelaas, the application automatically captures the current users location and date of the contact creation.
This information is then attached to the contact, and stored as a note on the created contact in the phones actual contacts. 
With this information attached to newly created contatcs, users will have a better chance of remembering who they are several years later.
